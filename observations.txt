Q1:

Euclid's Algorithm scales at LamÃ©'s Theorem: In carrying out the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two positive integers a and b, the number of steps needed will never exceed 5 times the number of base 10 digits in the smaller of the two integers a and b.

Relates to Golden Ratio (relates to fibonnaci sequence)

Q2:

Sieve of Eratosthenes, version 1, runs in O(n^2) or polynomial time.
This is rather inefficient, thus an alternative algorithm should be found. 
The issue must lie in the masking of the list. 
Line of Best Fit: [7.87 * 10^-9](x^1.83), R^2: 0.998

Sieve of Eratosthenes, version 2, runs in sub-O(n^2), potentially linear time (but unlikely).
The sieve / mask creation is more efficient. 
Line of Best Fit: [8.11 * 10^-8](x^1.08), R^2: 0.991

The results from the algorithm analysis show variance in high-n cases (ie; n > 5000000).

More test-cases need to be run, but algorithm runs in O( n * log ( log n )) time apparently
